# HTML_practice
This will be my first web page. The start of me documenting my journey in computer science.
I have added an element of pyscript. This seems like some really cool new technology that I can't wait to explore more of.

I have now covered most basic parts of HTML and will start to format the page with CSS. This is turning in to a nice guide for me to look back on to remember the different elements, what they do and how they work.
