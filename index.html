<p>This is an HTML page I created in Notepad.</p>

<p>This will demonstrate <b>bold</b> element.</p>

<p>This will now do the <i>italic</i>.</p>

<p>Using the <sup>super script</sup> will really help write math work.</p>

<p>I'm using <sub>sub script</sub> in computer context. Get your mind out of the gutter.</p>

<p>Sometimes there is a need to break up a paragraph with a line break.<br />This will make different parts of the text distinct.</p>
<!--update this only makes a new line it looks like.-->
   
<p>A line can also be used to section the page</p>
  
<hr />

<p><strong>The strong</strong> element will usually show up as bold but helps with text to voice or other accessablity tools<p>

<p><em>Emphasis</em> uses "em" and often shows up as italic.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.azquotes.com/quote/1728">
<p>A common mistake that people make when trying to design something completely foolproof is to underestimate the ingenuity of complete fools.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Douglas Adams. <q>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</q>

<p>As this web page becomes longer I will have to better show what each line is demonstrating.</p>
<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof</abbr> Stephen Hawking. Here I used "abbr" and the attribute "title" was used.</p>

<p><acronym title="Cutest Cat Ever">Shadow</acronym> is the best and deserves this title. I hope it works like I want.</p>

<p>This is the <dfn>Defining Instance</dfn> and "dfn" is used. The text appears in italic.</p>


<p>These elements are importent and different even if they look the same in browser.<br /> The "address" tag will put the informating in italic but will also help other apps identify this info.

<p><address>1234 Fake St Aurora, IL 60504</address></p>

<p><ins>"ins"</ins> will underline something that is to be inserted into a document. The <del>"del"</del> will put a line through something that should be kept in the document but is not true or accurate.</p>

 <div>
  <section id="list_sec">
<h2 id="lists">Section on Lists</h2>

<p>Ordered lists us "ol" to open the list and each element of the list gets a "li" open and closing element.</p>

<ol>
 <li>list item 1</li>
 <li>list item 2</li>
 <li>I like lists 3</li>
</ol>

<p>An unordered list uses bullet points</p>

<ul>
 <li>This list also uses "li"</li>
 <li>But the opeing is "ul"</li>
 <li>Lists can also be nested</li>
  <ul>
   <li>Another "ul" nested under an elemet</li>
   <li>With its own "li" for each item.</li>
   <li>Don't forget to close each level of "nesting".</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<p>Definition Lists seem to me to be quite like dictionaries in Python</p>

<dl>
  <dt>"dl" is used to open</dt>
   <dd>definition lists have a "key:value" syntax.</dd>
  <dt>"dt" will open the key</dt>
   <dd>"dd" will open the value.</dd>
